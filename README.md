- ⚡ Fun fact: Origin of 'Big Data': Coined in 1997 by NASA scientists, "Big Data" referred to data too large for standard databases. Today's data engineers handle even larger volumes.
              Data Lakes vs. Data Warehouses: Data engineers build 'Data Lakes' to store vast amounts of raw data and 'Data Warehouses' for organized, processed data.
              The Petabyte Age: We're in an era where handling a petabyte (1,000 terabytes) is routine for data engineers, far exceeding the human brain's storage capacity.
              SQL's Longevity: Developed in the 1970s, SQL is still a fundamental tool for data engineers to manage and retrieve data efficiently.
              The Speed of Data: Every second, millions of data points are created. Data engineers design systems to store and analyze this data swiftly.
